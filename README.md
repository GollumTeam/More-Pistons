More-Pistons
============

More Pistons Mod for Minecraft

To update this mod you need to have mcp and forge installed correctly. (I assume you already know how to do that.) put the folders, "assets" and "morepistons" into the mcp src/minecraft folder. (I also assume you know what your doing.) Now open in it Eclipse and you should be fine.
